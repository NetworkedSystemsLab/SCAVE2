# NetworkedSystemsLab SCAVE project

The Networked  Systems Lab (NSL) at the University of Central Florida is engaged in research on creating an accurate model of a road vehicle for real world, or testing and data collection applications, one may begin with designing it from the scratch to cater to the specific project requirements. For the purposes of this project, we aim demonstrate the motion of a standard size vehicle by the use of a customized small-scale (1/10 scale) vehicle for autonomous driving and vehicular communication. By scaling down the size of a real world system, one may fine-tune the various aspects of that system in a more workable and controlled manner.   This small-scale prototype accurately simulates an actual size vehicleâ€™s dynamics and kinematic behavior.  The model vehicle chosen utilizes a 4-wheel-drive platform with three LSDs (Front, Rear, and Center), as well as a rack-and-pinion steering system. The model's similarity to a full-scale vehicle's dynamics is crucial for the precise modeling of behavior, especially in cornering scenarios. Perception and machine vision of this vehicle is supported by a 3D LiDAR, a high-resolution stereo camera and depth sensor as well as medium range Infrared and Ultrasonic sensors which have been used for collision avoidance purposes. By utilizing an on-board, high-performance, and low-power NVIDIA AI supercomputer, this platform is capable of supporting the various sensors, communication devices (LTE, DSRC, Wi-Fi, etc.), and complex control algorithms. Moreover, it is powered by a hi-torque brushless electric powertrain and 2 battery packs which will yield an optimal operating time and range.
